# Fairness in AI without fitting a model

---

## Why Fairness? 

- COMPAS
- GenderShades
- Obermyer 

... we also note disparities in common ML benchmark data


---

Typical approaches:

- blame the data, not my problem
- repair the data (preprocessing)
- alter th elearning (inprocessing)
- change how the model is used (postprocessing)

---

An alternative approach:

reformulate the problems that we apply AI to so that they are better suited to producing socially acceptable outcomes

---

Obermyer is inspiration here

---

To do this: propose computationally efficient infomration theoretic quantities for evaluating problem setups

---

Agenda:

1. Information Theory (background)
2. AI Tasks (setup)
3. Information theoretic task fairness (main contribution)
4. Experiments (validation)
